<p>I’m Nat, a Graphic Designer based in Leeds with over eight years’​ industry experience. I love working on all sorts of creative projects, with organisations that can benefit from my friendly but contemporary design style. This is just a little snapshot of the things I’ve been doing.</p>

<p>After a brilliant few years leading the design team of an award winning students’ union, I decided to become self-employed and now work with some like-minded, creative folk in our creative collective, Let’s Dance.</p>

<p>Let’s Dance likes to help good people say good things. We do print, digital, branding and strategy for independents, charities and social enterprises.</p>
