I’m Nat, a Graphic Designer based in Leeds with over eight years’​ industry experience. I love working on all sorts of creative projects, with organisations that can benefit from my friendly but contemporary design style. This is just a little snapshot of the things I’ve been doing.

After a brilliant few years leading the design team of an award winning students’ union, I decided to become self-employed and now work with some like-minded, creative folk in our creative collective, Let’s Dance.

Let’s Dance likes to help good people say good things. We do print, digital, branding and strategy for independents, charities and social enterprises.
