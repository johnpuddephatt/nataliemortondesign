        <h3>What’ve I done?</h3>

    <div class="what-im-looking-for">
        <h3>What am I looking for?</h3>
        <p>Two things really motivate me: projects that will challenge me in a creative or technical sense, and projects that will help to make the world a better place.</p>
        <p>Anything that combines these two is a definite winner.</p>
